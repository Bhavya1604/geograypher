This page is a work in progress. Some main topics I'd like to cover are the following:

* What is in scope for geograyper. Mapping content between images, meshes, and geospatial coordinates is the main focus. Geograypher is designed to be used in workflows that use machine learning, but geograypher is explicitly designed to not perform machine learning itself.
* Software architecture: Geograypher is primarily an object oriented library.
* Main mathematical/algorithmic concepts. Geograypher leverages concepts from multiple fields such as geometric computer vision, graphics, and geospatial informatics.
* Roadmap: what features do we want to implement in the future. Primarily around object detection. And supporting more types of data and/or pluggable modules for rendering.
