The goal of this project is to identify the species of western conifers in regions which have been burned by severe fire in the past decade. Data was collected at four sites and consisted of both drone surveys and manual field surveys. This work showed geograypher's multiview workflow enabled 75% prediction accuracy on a leave-on-site-out prediction task. Details can be found in this ArXiv [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09544).
